# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

### Introduction
First part of three to create a full web application, an AirBnb clone. In this project, the objective is to write a command interpreter to manage AirBnb objects.

### Management of the objects include:

*    Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
*    Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
*    Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
*    Update attributes of an object
*    Destroy an object
